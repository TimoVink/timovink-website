If all goes well, this should be the first post on my new blog!

Ever since I learnt to program I've always _tinkered_ in my spare time: Playing with new languages or technologies, trying to replicate interesting demos, or implementing things from scratch to get a better understanding of what's happening under the hood.

These experiments rarely get anywhere close to being finished products, but I'd like to do more with them than just leave them to gather dust on my hard drive.

I'm not much of a writer, but I'm going to give blogging a try. I hope here I'll be able to share some of these experiments - no matter how small or incomplete - while providing appropriate context around what I'm hoping to achieve.


## First Project

The first project I'll be working on is the blog itself. My requirements are as follows:

 * It should be built from "scratch". Something like `react`, or `tailwindcss` is fair game, but I'd like to avoid using a ready-made CMS or component library.

 * It should be cheap to host. I'll start with a simple static site and see how long that meets my needs.

 * It should be easy to author and store blog posts. Ideally as plain-text files in, for example, [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

 * It should be able to support interactivity. I'd like to be able to easily embed live demos of some of my projects. While this sounds somewhat at odds with the previous requirement, there's potential via tools like [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).
