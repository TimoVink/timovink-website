While doing some cleanup recently I noticed I'd hit a tiny milestone: I now have over 50 unfinished projects cluttering my hard drive - with little intent on my part to revisit any of them.

Most of these were _eventually_ supposed to end up on GitHub, but none of them ever really did. With some I lost interest, while others barely made it to the prototype stage. Even those I worked on for quite some time were deemed [not good enough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) to share with the world.

That's a shame because I've gotten a lot of value and enjoyment out of hearing about other people's projects. I'm sure at least some of my projects and experiments would be of interest to others as well!

So in comes this blog: This is going to be my attempt to "journal" about my progress on these projects. I hope that this way I'll have an outlet to talk about projects even when they are nowhere close to being finished.


## First Project

The first project I'll be working on is this blog itself (repository [here](https://github.com/TimoVink/timovink-website)). My broad goals and requirements are as follows:

 * It should be built "from scratch". Something like `react`, or `tailwindcss` is fair game, but I'd like to avoid using a ready-made CMS or component library as I want full control and flexibility.

 * It should be cheap to host. I'll start with a simple static site and see how long that continues to meet my needs.

 * It should be easy to author and store blog posts. Ideally as [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files or something similar.

 * It should allow me to embed live demos of my projects. We'll explore how to combine this with the previous requirement in future posts.
